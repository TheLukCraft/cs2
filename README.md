## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/cnB9J0lap0hA.png?o=1)

CS2 is an exciting new project aimed at helping players improve their grenade throwing skills in the popular first-person shooter game, Counter Strike. The project focuses on a website that contains an extensive library of videos and photos demonstrating various grenade throwing techniques and strategies.

The site is designed to be friendly and intuitive, with easy navigation and search tools to help players quickly find the information they need. Users are encouraged to submit their own videos and photos demonstrating grenade throwing techniques, which are then reviewed and approved by the site's moderators before being added to the library. This helps ensure that the site's information is accurate and up-to-date, and allows players to learn from each other and share their own experiences.
